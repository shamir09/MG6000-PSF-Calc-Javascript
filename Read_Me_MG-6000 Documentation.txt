	System Approval: # FL18411	

	This webpage was created to facilitate the calculation of the Windload capacity the MG-6000 Series. The MG-6000 is an Impact Resistant Storefront/Fixed Window 
	System that supports 9/16" Laminated Glass or 1 5/16" Laminated Insulated Glass with both PVB & SGP options and can resist Wind Loads of -100.0 / +115.0 PSF.
		
	

	INPUT - the program uses two variables to calculate Windload.
		*Width    (format accepted: inches “)
		*Height   (format accepted: inches “)
			Under Development: 
				The insertion of vertical and horizontal lites to calculate Windload inserting total configuration.
				Glass Interlayer Composition (Pvb or SGP)
				Screw Options and corresponding pressures
				Drawing a Sketch of the system entered
					
DISCLAIMER    |     

	This program should not be used as the only resource to check for Windload Calculation.
