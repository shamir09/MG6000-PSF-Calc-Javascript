#### System Approval: FL18411

##### This webpage was created to facilitate the calculation of the Windload capacity the MG-6000 Series. The MG-6000 is an
	Impact Resistant Storefront/Fixed Window System that supports 9/16" Laminated Glass or 1 5/16" Laminated Insulated
	Glass with both PVB & SGP options and can resist Wind Loads of -100.0 / +115.0 PSF.

##### INPUT - the program uses two variables to calculate Windload.
		 *Width    (format accepted: inches ")
		 *Height   (format accepted: inches ")
			 Under Development:
				 Insertion of vertical & horizontal divisions/lites to calculate Windload
				 Glass Interlayer Composition (PVB or SGP)
				 Screw Options and corresponding pressures
				 Drawing a Sketch of the system entered

### DISCLAIMER    |

	 This program should not be used as the only resource to check for Windload Calculation.
